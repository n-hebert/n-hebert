# Hello!
I'm a Linux enthusiast working in various roles as a Back-end Software Developer and Platform Engineer for about a decade as of graduating my BCS in 2014.

## Blogs?!

## Working Together
For organizations, I'm currently open to contract/consult as , so do feel free to drop a line at n-hebert \[the at sign] outlook \[a dot] com to start a conversation.
